Technology Retrieval Task Force

Just remember: 
Not from other planets or dimensions or such,
but from the people and institutions which used 
our tax money for their "black projects" and 
the other ones, whatever color they may (have) 
use(d) for them. :)

This is our technology because we paid for it. Point.

It has to be open-sourced.

Everyone can be a member of TRTF because it's 
meant for everyone to use that technologies.

Thanks for your attention and
maybe thanks for your help.

Aaaand...don't forget to have some fun*. 
Meaning has no life without fun and vice versa. :)

Meaning of the badge symbolism:

+ The yellow border represents the sun, which gives light over everything.
+ The star represents the five time lines, see below.
+ The spiral "portal" inside the star represents the technology we want to retrieve.
+ White represents the blank space that you have like when you begin a new drawing: 
   Everything is open and possible at this point.
+ Blue represents the opposite, the ones we want the tech from. I don't like pure black.
   It could also represent the deep water, the wide and unexplored open space, heavens,
   or anything you want. Basically it's just a contrast colour.
+ Red is for the blood that was wasted hiding all that stuff from us.
   Or it's just another contrast colour.
+ Same with the yellow text: Looks better than White I think,
   or it just represents the sun like above. ;)
