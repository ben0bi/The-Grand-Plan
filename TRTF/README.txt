Technology Retrieval Task Force

Just remember: 
Not from other planets or dimensions or such,
but from the people and institutions which used 
our tax money for their "black projects" and 
the other ones, whatever color they may (have) 
use(d) for them. :)

This is our technology because we paid for it. Point.

It has to be open-sourced.

Everyone can be a member of TRTF because it's 
meant for everyone to use that technologies.

Thanks for your attention and
maybe thanks for your help.

Aaaand...don't forget to have some fun*. 
Meaning has no life without fun and vice versa. :)
