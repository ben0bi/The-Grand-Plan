Technology Retrieval Task Force

Just remember: 
Not from other planets or dimensions or such,
but from the people and institutions which used 
our tax money for their "black projects" and 
the other ones, whatever color they may (have) 
use(d) for them. :)

This is our technology because we paid for it. Point.

It has to be open-sourced.

Everyone can be a member of TRTF because it's 
meant for everyone to use that technologies.

TRTF Missions:
00: Not to be revealed to the public right now, sorry.
First, the law must be changed. Globally. It's on the way. ;)

01: Open at nightshift
(That one can buy the stuff outside of regular open times.)
(There are people who are awake when everyone other sleeps.
This is discriminating for this people...)

02: Make better places. Make places better. See the betterplace-paper.

Thanks for your attention and
maybe thanks for your help.

Aaaand...don't forget to have some fun*. 
Meaning has no life without fun and vice versa. :)
